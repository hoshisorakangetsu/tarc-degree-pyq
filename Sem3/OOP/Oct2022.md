# Q1

## a)
- Class
  - Blueprint or template to create objects
  - Logical entity
  - Created once
  - Doesn't allocate memory when created
  - Declared using `class` keyword
- Object
  - An instance of the class
  - Physical entity
  - Can be multiple times as per requirement 
  - Allocate memory when created
  - Created using `new` keyword

## b)
- Advantage of OOP
  - Can reuse code
    - Subclasses can inherit the methods and data properties that their parent classes provide, programmers don't need to rewrite them
  - Better security
    - In OOP, encapsulation is provided and it allow program to hide data property using private modifier and access to it with getter and setter
  - Easy to maintain
    - All related data properties will be store together in one class
- OOP is chosen to create complex and long program
  - Reduce cost when developing the program as OOP programs are easy to maintain
  - Increase programmer efficiency as codes can be reuse and they do not need to rewrite code

## c)
Skip, not in syllabus

## d)
> probably not in syllabus as well, idk i no read notes
- Exception class represents every single exception in java, therefore when Exception is caught, it means that every type of exceptions will be caught, and the error will occur if we attempt to catch any other exceptions after catching the Exception
- Solution 1: Move the whole catch ArrayIndexOutOfBounds block to before the catch Exception block, suitable for when there are special handlings required to be done
- Solution 2: Remove the whole catch ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception block (my solution as the handling for both block is the same)
```java
public class ExceptionDemo {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    try {
      String a = "78";
      Integer.parseInt(a);
      int i = 0;
      int y = 34 / i;
    } catch (Exception ex) {
      System.out.println(ex.getMessage());
    }
  }
}
```

## e)
```java
import java util.Scannner;
public class Input {
  public static void main(String [] args) {
    Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.print("Enter a String:");
    String input = s.nextLine();
    int consonants = 0;

    for(int i = 0; i < input.length(); i++) {
      char c = Character.toLowerCase(input.charAt(i));
      if(
        c != 'a' && 
        c != 'e' &&
        c != 'i' &&
        c != 'o' &&
        c != 'u'
      ) {
        consonants++;
      }
    }

    System.out.println("Total number of consonants: " + consonants);
  }
}
```

# Q2

## a)
- instance method
  - unique to the instance
  - usually called using the instances
  - can access static variables
  - `public int getCalculatedFats()`
- static method
  - owned by the class that defined it
  - shared by all instances of the class
  - usually called by using the class name
  - has the keyword `static`
  - cannot access instance variables
  - `public static void main()`
- Static method is preferrable when the method does not interact with the instance variables but still provides some kind of functionalities, for example, the `Character.toLowerCase()` method does not interact with any instances and it solely returns a character that is transformed into lowercase for us

## b)
- Because abstract classes should be inherited by subclasses, and when a subclass wants to inherit a superclass, they will need to call the constructor of the respective superclass, therefore, abstract classes do need to have a constructor, especially a no-arg constructor

## c)
- `==` operator compares whether the two instances are the exact same instance, for example, they are located at the same location
- `equals` method can be overriden by the respective classes, allowing the programmer to actually compare what they want to compare, usually the value of something
- `compareTo` method can be overriden by the respective classes as well, the way it differs from the `equals` method is `compareTo` compares and return values whether the two objects are equal, less than or greater than each other
```java
String s = new String("Hewwo"); 
String s2 = s; 
String s3 = new String("Hewwo");
String s4 = new String("Hello");

s == s2; // true
s == s3; // false
s.equals(s3); // true
s.compareTo(s4); // positive integer to signify s is bigger than s4
```

## d)
- Polymorphism is the ability to have the same name of method but different behavior depending on different class family
- ability to use to the same method to denote different implmentation (from notes)
- In Java, supporting inheritance typically means that the subclasses inherits all the data and methods of their parent class, therefore, the subclass have the ability to *override* the methods, creating polymorphism as it will also have the same name to mark the methods, but they both will have different implementations

## e)
```java
u = new Undergraduate();  // legal, u can hold objects of Undergraduate as it is the same type
s = u;                    // legal, superclass can hold objects of its subclasses
p = (Postgraduate) u;     // illegal, cannot cast directly from one subclass to another subclass
s = new Postgraduate();   // legal, superclass can hold objects of its subclasses
u = new Student();        // illegal, subclass cannot access to the constructor of the superclass
u = s;                    // illegal, s is now object of Postgraduate, which is not same datatype
```

# Q3

## a)
- interface (?? dk what purpose and one mark nia)
```java
public interface SomeRandomInterface {}
```

## b)
```java
// they call us exclude setter and getter for all instance variables
public abstract class Ticket {
  private TicketType ticketType;
  private static int totalTicketSold = 0;

  public Ticket(TicketType ticketType) {
    this.ticketType = ticketType;
  }

  public abstract calculatePrice();
  
  public static int getTotalTicketSold() {
    return totalTicketSold;
  }

  public static void sellTickets(int ticketSold) {
    Ticket.totalTicketSold = Ticket.totalTicketSold - ticketSold;
  }

  public String toString() {
    return String.format("Ticket type: %s\nOriginal Price:RM %.2f\n", ticketType, ticketType.getPrice());
  }
}
```

## c)
```java
import java util.Date;
public class RegularTicket extends Ticket {
  // technically this shud be in Ticket class since VIP and Regular both have these, but unable come up with things that only Regular have and VIP dh so will just put here
  private String ticketID;
  private Date dateAdmission;
  private static int currentRegID = 1001;
  
  public RegularTicket(TicketType ticketType) {
    super(ticketType);
    ticketID = String.format("R%d", currentRegID);
    currentRegID++;
    dateAdmission = new Date();
  }

  public double calculatePrice() {
    double price = super.ticketType.getPrice() * 1.2;
    return price;
  }

  public String toString() {
    return super.toString + String.format("Price after TAX:RM .2f\n", calculatePrice());
  }
}

public class VIPTicket extends Ticket {
  private String ticketID;
  private Date dateAdmission;
  private int seatNumber;
  private static int ticketLeft = 100;
  private static int currentVIPID = 1001;

  public VIPTicket(TicketType ticketType, int seatNumber) {
    super(ticketType);
    ticketID = String.format("V%d", currentVIPID);
    dateAdmission = new Date();
    currentVIPID++;
    ticketLeft--;
  }

  public static int getTicketLeft() {
    return ticketLeft;
  }

  public double calculatePrice() {
    double price = super.ticketType.getPrice() * 1.2;
    return price;
  }

  public String toString() {
    return super.toString() + String.format(
      "Seat Number:%d\nPrice after TAX:RM%.2f",
      seatNumber, calculatePrice()
    );
  }
}
```

## d)
```java
// missing code 1 instantiate object of each type
if (selection == 3) {
  int seat = scanner.nextInt();
  ticket[i] = new VIPTicket(ticketType, seat);
} else {
  // both regular and early bird ticket also is RegularTicket because they mention RegularTicket is the general admission ticket type
  ticket[i] = new RegularTicket(ticketType);
} 

// missing code 2 and 3 (display VIP tickets left, display total tickets sold)
System.out.println("VIP tickets left:" + VIPTicket.getTicketLeft());
System.out.println("Total ticket sold until now:" + Ticket.getTotalTicketSold());
```

# Q4

## a)
> format zhijie very difference, very confused, so no do

## b)
- Aggregation
  - Object can be shared with other objects
  - Aggregated object (child) can exist independently without the Object being aggregated into (parent)
  - An object can be owned by several other aggegrating objects(notes)
- Composition
  - The object is execusively owned by other object
  - An object that is excusively owned by an aggegrating object(notes)
  - Composition is actually a special cases of aggregation(notes)
- Implementation of aggregation and composition in java is similar, below, Child can be considered as aggregated into Prnt, and can also be considered as composited into Prnt
```java
class Prnt {
  Child someObj;
}
```
