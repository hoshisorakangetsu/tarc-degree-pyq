# Q1

## a)
- PC5 prepares a packet to be delivered to PC0, which is not on the same network
- PC5 will forward the packet to the configured gateway of its network, which is 192.168.20.1/24
- Router 1 receives the packet, and identifies the network address of the destination IP address (the IP address of PC0)
- Router 1 will look into its routing table to find the matching network address, which is not present in this case
- Router 1 will forward the package to the default gateway, which is 192.168.30.4
- Then the router of the default gateway (192.168.30.4) will decide where to forward the packet based on its routing table (hopefully it will be delivered to PC0)

## b) Our syllabus dh 5
- More address space
- Better handling of packet
- Problem with current Network Address Translation (NAT)
- Integrated security

# Q2

## a)

### i)
- 168.212.226.204
  - Class B
  - Network Portion: First 2 bytes
  - Host Portion: Last 2 bytes

### ii)
- 102.168.212.226
	- Class A
	- Network Portion: First 1 bytes
  - Host Portion: Last 3 bytes

## b)
- 2 Subnets
  - 2^1 = 2, which is enough for 2 subnets, we will use one bit for the subnetting
  - 2 ^ (8-1) = 2^7 = 128, 128 - 2 = 126, this will give us 126 hosts per subnet
  - First subnet: 
    - 192.168.2.0/25 (network address)
		- 192.168.2.1/25 (first usable)
		- 192.168.2.126/25 (last usable)
		- 192.168.2.127/25 (broadcast address)
  - Second subnet:
    - 192.168.2.128/25 (network address)
    - 192.168.2.129/25 (first usable)
    - 192.168.2.254/25 (last usable)
    - 192.168.2.255/25 (broadcast address)

## c)

### i)
- 2^3=8 subnets

### ii)
- 3

### iii)
- 2^13 = 8192, 8192-2=8190

### iv)
- /19

# Q4

## a)
- The DNS protocol is used to translate domain name into IP address
- Client send a DNS query to the DNS server to resolve the domain name into IP address
- DNS server tries to lookup on its own records
- If the record is not found, DNS server forwards the request to another server
- Once the IP address is found, the DNS server will response by sending back the DNS query response to the cilent
- Once the cilent receive the the DNS query response, it will save a copy of the resolved record in its memory

## b)
- Does Retransmission
	- If the packet is corrupt or lost, it will resend the packet again
- Handles Reordering
  - Same order delivery
- Reliable
  - Ensure all packet arrive
- Flow control
  - Can reduce send rate if the receiving side low on resource
- Connection-oriented
  - Establish connection before sending the data

## c)
- This statement is false. The application layer of the TCP/IP model performs the functions of Application, Presentation and Session layer of the OSI model
