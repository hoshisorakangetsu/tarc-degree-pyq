# Q1

## a)
Usability is defined in ISO 9241 as the extent to which a product can be used by a specified user to achieve a specified goal with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction in a specified context of use

## b)
- TARC student
  - Increase productivity
    - High efficiency, minimum resources are used to achieve tasks
  - Reduce learning time
    - develop transferable skills
  - Reduce error
    - High effectiveness, all the informations are accurate
  - Reduce stress
    - Less likely to create errors
- Developer
  - Good reputation
    - Good comments from the customer
  - Reduce training time
    - Easy to understand and learn the system
  - Reduce customer support cost
    - Easy to learn by the user so they will have less questions

## c)
- Persona
  - A persona is the user model that represents a specific individual, however it is not the real person, but it is created based on real world observation
  - Include activity, attitude, goals, pain points, skills
  - We can observe TARC student and create a persona, this can help identify the frustrations so we can avoid it during design of the new system
- Hierarchical Task Analysis (HTA)
  - Break down tasks into subtasks
  - Can make the new system compatible with the user's knowledge of the old system
  - For example, identify the steps required to borrow the books in the current system
- Scenario
  - Usually involves environment and specific persona
  - Help us know how user do task
  - For example, with scenario we can idetify when and where the user will use the library system and how the user borrow the borrow the book from library system

# Q2

## a)
- Physical capabilities
  - Elderly
    - Vision: Unable to see things very clearly
    - Sound: Narrower hearing range
    - Movement: Slower to give response to the things happening
  - Teenager
    - Vision: Can see things clearly
    - Sound: Normal hearing range 20Hz - 15kHz
    - Movement: Standard response time to the things happening around
- Cognitive capabilities
  - Attention
    - Elderly: Harder to focus on one thing for a very long time
    - Teenager: Able to focus on one thing for a very long time
  - Recognition
    - Metaphors carry different meaning for the elderly and teenagers

## b)
- Offer warning
  - Emit a heavy sound once an error has occured for example when the magazine fails to load to allow the user to identify the warning rapidly
- Confirm action
  - Use sound to prompt the user for confirmation messages for example can prompt a short sad sound when asking whether the user really want to quit the application
- Provide mood of context
  - Allow the user to immerse more into the task they doin (in this case, ambient sound can be played to help the user focus in reading the magazine)

## c)
- When the navigation bar in the app has applied consistency, it means that it has the same function and places at the same location at all pages
- Once the elderly has successfully learned the function of navigation bar and their location at one page, they can apply the same knowledge accross all the pages
- Therefore, the learning curve of the app has reduced as it allow the elderly to develop transferable skills

## d)
- Allow customisations for example let the users choose what to display in the home page of the magazine app like the favorite magazines or whether the recommendation section should appear in the home screens

# Q3

## a)
- STM
  - Fast decay
  - Fast access
  - Limited capacity
- LTM
  - Slow decay
  - Slow access
  - Unlimited capacity

## b)
- Offer simple error handling
  - System offer simple mechanism to handle error
  - When error message is display, the error message shuold provide the way to recover from error
- Support internal locus of control
  - Give user the ability to initiate the action rather than response to the action
  - Let the user to choose when to update the system, instead directly update the system without permission of user
- Reduce short term memory load
  - Chunking: Group items of similar properties together into a chunk

## c)
- A company is developing a new website. They create a prototype of the website that is controlled by a human wizard. The wizard is hidden from the users and will respond to their requests as if the website were actually working. This allows the company to test the usability of the website before it is launched
- Good communication tool between designer and cilent
- Inexpensive
- Fast to develop
- Good to test multiple design
- Address layout design

# Q4

## a)
- Field study
  - Advantage: natural, context retained environment
  - Disadvantage: easily distracted
- Lab study
  - Advantage: uninterrupt environment
  - Disadvantage: Hard to observe multiple user cooperate
- Factor taken into consideration (dk luan luan gang):
  - Location of system
  - Importance of context

## b)
- Track progress between two versions
  - Determine whether which version has the better peformance
- Determine whether product is ready to be released
  - Identify the product is good and no error before released
- Track competitive level with other companies
  - Identify is the product ready to compete with other company product
  - Determine whether the product is better than the other company

## c)
- Match between system and real world
  - Apply metaphor
	  - Use the real life icon to represent the action of button
	  - For example, the home icon at the button means that once the button is click it will navigate to home page
- Recognition rather than recall
  - Reduce user's memory load
    - Provide options to be selected rather than let user recall from memory and type it out
    - For example, provide options of available coupuns rather than having the user memorise the discount code
- Visibility of system status
  - Provide feedbacks regarding the current system status
	  - For example, provide clear heaeder at every page
