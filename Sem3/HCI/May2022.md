# Q1

## a)
- Cause anxiety and stress
  - The user is more likely to make an error when the design is bad, as there may exist gulf of execution
  - For example, the user may formulate the wrong intention or execute the wrong action
  - When the user found out that the action they have done produce error, they will feel uneasy, accumulating stress and anxiety
  - Especially if the system did not offer simple handling, it can cause the user to be even more stressed
- Decrease user productivity
  - It is difficult to use and learn when the system has a bad interface design such as inconsistency
  - Therefore, the user might use longer time to find the action that want to carry out and learn the system
  - For example, when the system does not have consistency, the user will not be able to develop transferable skills and they will need to learn the system again when they are in other page.

## b)
- Example of system use: touchscreen interface
- Computer Science
  - Provide knowledge about capabilities and limitations of technology
  - Developed algorithms to recognize multiple gestures like tap, swipe drag etc.
- Cognitive Psychology
  - Provide the knowledge of how the user will process the information
  - Cognitive psychologists have made an effort to research how people perceive and remember visual information, they have used the research to design touchscreen interfaces that are more easy to understand

## c)
- Cause stress and anxiety
  - This is because human short term memory has only some limited spaces
  - If there are many information and cause overtaxing user short term memory, they might feel stressed as they need to try their best to remember all of them
  - For example, when the user wants to apply a discount, they will need to try their best to recall the voucher code from their STM, in order to insert the code into the discount field
- Inefficiency
  - Use more time to process information
  - Therefore, the user might need to carry out extra actions when they are trying to compare the items they want to buy
  - For example, when the user wants to compare two books, but the interface is cluttered with products of all category, and the two books user want to compare might not place in the same page, therefore the user will need to memorize the information about the    
    book.
- Solution
  - Recognition rather than recall
    - Instead of letting user remember discount voucher codes, let the user select from available vouchers
  - Chunking
    - Chunk products based on their category

## d)
- Create persona
  - Persona is a user model that represent an individual, specific person. However, they are not real person but they are created based real world observation.
  - Includes skills, attitude, goals, pain points, activities
  - We can observe multiple TARUC students and create personas based on them, that identifies their goals using the application and their activities they normally carry out to identify how the application can fit in their life
- Scenario
  - How user carry out the job
  - It usually involve with enviromental and persona
  - We need to create the scenario based on the how the persona use the application and where and when they will use the application to find their study group.
- Environment analysis
  - Usage patterns that include environmental 
  - considerations
  - In what environment is the product used
  - For example, since this is a mobile application, it can be used both indoors and outdoors, however, it is most likely be used indoors as people normally study indoors
- Task analysis
  - Can identify how the student study with a study group in the current system
  - Perform Hierarchical Task Analysis
    - Break down tasks into subtasks
    - To make new system compatible with the current way the user does the job

# Q2

## a)

### i) 
- Reason: Encourage user to explore the system
  - When the user knows that all the actions that done is reversal, they can explore the system bravely in order to find out all features that in the application
- Reason 2: Reduce stress and anxiety
  - The elderly usually is against learning new technology since they scare they might carry out some inappropriate action and might cause error in the system. With permit an easy reversal of action is applied to the system, the elderly can remove their stress and anxity for carry out inappropriate action. Once they know that they action is reserval, they will be willing to accept and use the system to report their loss.
- Example: Allow the user to edit their previous reports or even cancel them
  - The user may have been submitted a report accidentally when using the system, when they are exploring to learn how to use it

### ii)
- Reason: Enhance learnability
  - Reduced learning curve
    - With consistency is applied to the system, the elderly will be able to learn the system much more faster. With consistency, the icon use in the whole system will be having the same button, therefore when they learn the knowledge in one page, they can transfer skills that they have learned in the page acrorss the whole system.
- Example: use consistent icon and button designs across the application
  - When the button design is consistent across the application, the user can immediately know that it is a button without having to think what the element does, and with consistent icon design, especially consistent with other application's metaphor, users that have used the other application can transfer the skills they have from other applications and learn this application quickly
  - For example, the Camera icon directly tells the user that by pressing it, it will allow the user to take pictures of something

### iii)
- Resources used
  - Time used
    - When the user start perform the task, we record the start time and once the user complete the task, see the time used
  - Effort used
    - The amount of thinking that the user have to go through when performing a task
    - Number of actions that the user took when performing every step
  - RAM usage
    - Record down the RAM usage when the application is running
  - Memory usage
    - Record down the memory usage when the application is running
  - CPU usage
    - Record down the CPU usage when the application is running

## b)
- Why Lofi
  - Good communication tools between desinger and user
  - Compare multiple design
  - Fast to brainstorm idea
  - Lower cost to develop
  - Address layout design

## c)
- Temperature
  - Optimal temperature: 20 to 24 degree celsius
  - Temperature too high or low will affect the performance of worker.
  - Once the performance of the worker is effect, the productivity of worker will be reduced and quality of work submit also reduced
  - If temperature too high or low, worker will sick easily and feel uncomfort
- Lighting
  - Make sure the lighting is at a comfortable level
  - Unsuitable lighting (too bright or too dull) can cause eyes disorder like sore eyes, blurred vision and red and watery eyes (health)
