ADT AreaShape
Area of a shape is the size of the surface.

Double triangleShape(Double b, Double h)
Description: Calculate the area of triangle
Precondition: b and h must be double 
Postcondition: The value of b and h remain unchanged
Returns: Area of triangle

Double rectangleArea(Double w, Double h)
Description: Calculates the area of a rectangle
Precondition: w and h must be double
Postcondition: The value of w and h remains unchanged
Returns: Area of the rectangle

Double squareArea(Double a)
Description: Calculate the area of square
Precondition: a must be double 
Postcondition: The value of a remain unchanged
Return: Area of square

Double circleArea(Double r)
Description: Calculates the area of a circle
Precondition: r must be double
Postcondition: The value of r remains unchanged
Returns: Area of the circle
```

    public double triangleShape(double b, double h);
    public double rectangleArea(double w, double h);
    public double squareArea(double a);

}
```

## c
```java
public class AreaCalculator implements AreaShape {
  public double triangleShape(double b, double h) {
    return 0.5 * b * h;
  }
  
  public double rectangleArea(double w, double h){
    return w * h;
  }
  
  public double squareArea(double a) {
    return rectangleArea(a, a);
  }

  public double circleArea(double r) {
    return Math.PI * Math.pow(r, 2);
  }
}

# Q2

## a
Traverse the string one character at a time, ignoring everything else other than brackets, like (), [] and {}. When an open bracket is visited, like (, [, {, they will be pushed into the stack. When a close bracket is visited, like ), ], }, an open bracket will be popped out from the stack, and it will be matched against the closing bracket, if the pair does not match, the brackets are not balance, else the traversal proceeds. In the end of traversal, if the stack is empty, then the brackets are balance.
