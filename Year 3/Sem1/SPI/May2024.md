- Law
  - Law refers to the traditional form of regulation enforced through legislation and the legal system.
  - In this case, it may imply that the original or existing laws may not be able to cover the emergence of AI.
  - Thus, laws may need to be modified or enhanced to protect users. This implies that governments may create new laws or make revisions on current laws, and this affects individuals such that their rights are being protected.
  - For example, government may create a new law such that all interactions with AI must be encrypted, this will help protect the privacy of the users of the AI. 
- Social Norm
  - Social norm refers to the unwritten rules and expectation that govern behaviour of a specific society or community.
  - In this case, the rise of AI may change the using behaviour and expectations of the user for an application.
  - This might cause the user to be lazy to think when facing a problem, making them seek for the help of AI when they face the problem.
  - For example, the rise of ChatGPT has change the daily life of people such as during work, people can use ChatGPT to help them write an email or solve the problem face during working.
- Market
  - Market refer to the mechanism of economic exchange and regulation that are driven by demand and supply.
  - In this case, different players in the market will integrate AI in their own application to fulfill the expectation of their users.
  - This will create new job opportunities as integrating AI in the application will need professional knowledge from experts, thus this will help more people to be able to be employed, increasing the average income of a country.
  - For example, when a company want to integrate AI to provide visual search function in the application, they might need to hire new employees that have the knowledge about AI. Hence, once they are hired, it will increase the average income of the country.
- Architecture/Technology
  - Architecture refer to the design of physical or digital system and the platform that shape and control behaviour.
  - In this case, the rise of AI will attract researcher to research regarding AI explore the full potential of it.
  - This will introduce new algorithm that may be more powerful than the existing ones, hence, it will increase the using experience of user by being able to give more accurate responses or in a quicker manner.
  - For example, the discovery of ReAct made the usage of LLMs more powerful as it gives a framework for LLMs to give reasons for their actions. This will help user to better understand how an LLM came to the conclusion and trust their actions more.

- Lack of infrastructure
	- The infrastructure is the important part when perform digital transformation, as without the infrastructure the technology cannot be build. Therefore, making the digital transformation difficult to be carrried out.
	- For example, without enough power supply, data centre cannot be built and introduce in the country. One possible solution to this is to import the power supplies.
- Lack of expert
	- The expert is an important part for perform digital transformation, without the expert the technology cannot be built as it require the knowledge about the technology.
	- For example, if the country does not have expert that the technology required, the technology cannot be build and introduce in the country. One possible solution to this is to hire expert from other country.
- Lack of legislation
  - During digital transformation, certain bad actors may find loopholes in the current legal systems as the previous legal advisor designing the legal system may fail to consider a certain condition. 
  - For example, the current legal system may not have defined laws to punish bad actors performing hacking activities to obtain digitized versions of user data being stored. One possible solution is to revise and update the current legal systems as the transformation is happening.

- Dangerous behavioral contents
  - In most games, it allows the controller to perform many high risk actions that may harm the user in the real world but does not harm the character in the game.
  - For example, most games allows or even encourages players to perform dangerous actions such as jumping between different buildings or jump down from a high building.
  - This would effect the player into thinking that such actions in the real world is possible, and may tempt the player into trying to perform such actions in the real world and when they do, it brings significant harm to the user as well as the people around them as falling from a high building may have the risk of crashing into other people as well. 
- Violent Contents
	- In some games, it allow the gamer to control the character to kill the NPC or performing crime without telling the gamer the action is incorrect.
	- Therefore, the gamer might think that those action they perform in game can be perform in real life. Hence, leading to a society issue when the gamer try to perform those action in the society.
  - For example, in the GTA game, it allow the gamer to rob the bank and kill the police, hence promoting violance.
- Addictive Contents
  - Most games are designed to attract their players to spend more time in the game, and to achieve this they will attempt to design their game around addictive contents.
  - For example, most games come with a reward system that rewards you more as you stay in the game for a longer time.
  - This will cause the player to be addicted to the game and wanted to spend more time in the game, ultimately reducing their time or their will to interact with the people around them. 
- Competition and frustrations
  - In some game, it allow the gamer to compete with other gamer around the world and having the ranking system to differentiate the player.
  - Therefore, the gamer will play the game very focus and tense to increase their ranking in the game. However, if the gamer lose their game it will cause them feel frustratation hence become aggressive.
  - For example, in LOL game, it has a rank mode that allow the gamer to have a different rank in the game. Therefore, when the gamer lose their rank game, they will feel frustration hence become aggressive.

- Freedom to Use: Most open-source licenses grant users the right to use the software for any purpose, whether personal, educational, or commercial, without discrimination. This ensures that no entity can impose limitations on the way the software is used, promoting universal access (e.g., MIT License, Apache License).
- Right to Study and Modify: Open-source licenses provide access to the source code, allowing users to study, understand, and modify the software. This transparency encourages learning, innovation, and customization, as seen in licenses like the GNU General Public License (GPL), which promotes software freedom by explicitly requiring source code distribution.
- Right to Distribute: Open-source licenses allow the redistribution of the original or modified versions of the software, either for free or for a fee. The GPL, for instance, requires that the same freedoms granted by the original software be passed on to any redistributed versions, ensuring the software remains open.

- Typosquatting refer to the deceptive action where individuals or organisation intentionally register domain name that highly resemble popular or well known domain name but usually contain typographical error or slighly invariants. 
- For example, typosquatters may replace booking.com with bo0king.com or boooking.com.
- This may have the ability to phish or scam a certain individuals. Continuing from the above example, the typosquatters may create a page that looks like booking.com and registers it under a similar domain name such as boooking.com. In practice, the typosquatter will be able to trick the user into entering their payment details into the fake boooking.com website to obtain their payment credentials.
- Once the scammer obtain the payment credentails, they will use the payment credentails to pay for the product they wanted to purchase.
- For another example, typosquatters may use microsaft.com to replace microsoft.com.
- This will give the typosquatters an opportunity to distribute malwares in the disguise of microsoft office downloads.

- Promotes Inclusivity and Diversity of Opinions
  - The multi-stakeholder model allows for broad participation from various groups, including governments, private companies, civil society, technical experts, and individual users. This inclusivity ensures that decisions are made with input from a diverse range of perspectives and interests, which is essential given that the Internet is a global resource. By involving different stakeholders, ICANN ensures that no single entity or country dominates Internet governance, which could otherwise lead to biased policies or control over key resources like domain names.
  - For example, if only governments were involved, Internet governance could lean towards censorship or increased regulation, while involvement from technical experts ensures that decisions are made with a focus on the Internet's technical functionality and security. The multi-stakeholder approach balances these interests.
- Safeguards Against Government Overreach
  - ICANN's multi-stakeholder model is specifically designed to prevent any single government or group of governments from controlling the Internet. By involving a range of stakeholders, ICANN aims to keep decision-making power decentralized and transparent. This is particularly important because if Internet governance were controlled solely by governments, some may be tempted to impose political agendas, such as censorship, surveillance, or limiting freedom of expression.
  - For instance, countries with stricter control over Internet content may try to influence DNS decisions in a way that enables greater censorship or control over content at the global level. By preventing governments from having unilateral control, ICANN’s multi-stakeholder model helps to preserve Internet openness and neutrality.
- Ensures Technical Stability and Security
  - The Internet’s infrastructure, particularly the Domain Name System (DNS), is critical to its functioning, and ICANN plays a central role in managing this infrastructure. Multi-stakeholder control ensures that technical experts from around the world have a voice in governance. This is crucial for maintaining the security, stability, and interoperability of the global Internet.
  - ICANN collaborates with various technical bodies, including the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), to ensure that the Internet continues to function smoothly across all countries and regions. This collaboration helps address challenges like cyberattacks or system outages, which could disrupt global Internet access. A model that includes technical experts ensures that decisions are made based on sound engineering principles, thus maintaining the integrity of the Internet’s infrastructure.
- Preserves Freedom of Expression and Open Access
  - A core value of the Internet is that it should remain an open platform where people can freely express their opinions and share information. ICANN’s multi-stakeholder model plays a vital role in protecting this principle by preventing any single party, especially governments or corporations, from controlling access to or regulating the content available on the Internet.
  - There is a risk that if one group held too much power, they could push for domain-level takedowns that stifle freedom of speech. For instance, a government could influence domain name management to remove websites critical of its policies. By maintaining a governance model that includes civil society and advocates for freedom of expression, ICANN ensures that the Internet remains a free and open space for all users, which is essential for democratic participation and the free flow of information.

- Negative utilitarianism is an ethcal theory based on utilitarianism that unlike other utilitarianism theories that emphasizes maximizing happiness, negative utilitarianism focuses on minimizing suffering even we have to give up some happiness. 
- Passitivity
  - Negative utilitarianism may oppose taking positive actions and instead suggest taking no action as the best action just because the positive actions may bring certain risks.
  - For example, a negative utilitarian approach might oppose developing new medical treatments if they carry any risk of harm, even if they could potentially save countless lives. This overly cautious approach could prevent the development of beneficial technologies and innovations, hindering overall societal well-being.
- Neglect of positive value
  - Negative utilitarianism may neglect the positive value of the action as the action will cause some negative effects although the positive value is many times over the negative effects.
  - For example, a negative utilitarian approach might oppose developing new technology if the new technology will bring negative value, even the new technology is way better than the current technology. This is because when the new technology is introduced, the people that work using their old technology knowledge might lose their job as their knowledge are no longer required. This bring the negative value, although the new technology will change the life of the people in the world in a good way. This approach might limit the development of technology and society.

- Mandatory counselling
  - Educate the criminal about the action conducted by them is an incorrect action allowing them to identify the error that they have made.
  - Through counselling, the criminal will be able to learn from the mistake they have made and not performing the same action again.
  - After knowing the impact of the action, they will know and learn from the mistake again.
  - For example, after commit the crime, the criminal will go through counselling to let them notice their mistake and aware of the impact of the action they made. By noticing and aware of the impact of the action, they will not make the same mistake again.
- Fine
  - Fines are another frequent punishment for malware crimes, and their amount can vary greatly depending on the severity of the offense. In some cases, fines can be substantial, especially for corporations found guilty of large-scale data breaches or other significant cybercrimes. 
  - For example, under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union, organizations can face fines of up to €20 million or 4% of their annual global turnover for violations.
- Imprisonment
  - This is a common punishment for serious malware crimes, especially when significant harm has been caused. The length of imprisonment can vary widely depending on the severity of the offense. 
  - For example, individuals convicted of hacking into critical infrastructure systems and causing widespread disruption could face lengthy prison sentences.
