## a
- Sandbox: Checkout file are placed in the workplace that can be change feely. This eliminates the need to lock the original source files in the original repository.
- Isolation: Each developer will have at least a separate workplace that is isolated. This allows the developer to write, test, debug and run the code without affecting the work of other developers.

## b
- Cannot identify when the bug happen or which code introduced the bug, causing it hard to identify which part of the code needs to be changed in order to fix any errors.
- Cannot identify whether modifying a certain part of the code will impact other parts of the system as the code is not traceable without a configuration management.
- Lack of configuration management may cause an unmaintained documentation, which may potentially be outdated. This will cause that when the developer is trying to fix a certain error, they might be unable to identify what are the expected behaviors due to a lack of documentation.

## c
- Resevere engineering: Interpretation.
  - In the interpretation phase, one of the activity is programming reading. This involves understanding the source code and making a higher level abstraction or interpretation on the source code.
- Forward engineering: Regeneration
  - In the regeneration phase, one of the activity is producing codes. This turn the higher level abstractions of the system into lower level implementations like codes that can be executed.

## d
### i
- Re-code. No, one cannot start at abstraction level design, make code changes which corresponds to the abstaction level implementation, because the abstraction level design is higher than abstraction level implmentation.
- Re-design. Yes, redesign produces changes that corresponds to the abstraction level design.
- Re-specify. Bad, the system can be created, but the likelihood of producing a good result is low as respecify produces changes on abstraction level requirements, which is higher than abstraction level design, which would render the efforts done in abstraction level design to be useless.

# 2
## a
- Adherence. The ability to produce the Candidate Impact Set (CIS) as close as the Actual Impact Set (AIS). If the CIS is the same with the AIS, this means that the impact analsysis is effective.

## b
- Control dependency edge
  - The line to represent the edge is dotted line
  - Demonstrate how the execution of a statement will impact the other statements
- Data dependency edge
  - The line to represnt the edge is solid line
  - The edge represent the flow of data between the statements

## c
### i
- Lack of documentation. With the lack of documentation, the developers will need more effort to understand the current system.
- Written in obsolete programming language. As the system is more than ten year, the programming language might already obsolete and causing developers need longer time to understand the system.

### ii
- Redevelop the system by resuming existing function
  - Cost: Expensive and require significant time and effort
  - Risk of not getting certain key functionalities correct: It is possible that the redeveloped system did not get a certain function correct as the functionalities' implementation may be very different with the original one due to prolonged evolution throughout the servicing lifetime of the system
  - User Training: Need to provide training to all the existing users
- Keep maintaining the system
  - The cost of maintaining the system will continue increased as the programmers that has the knowledge about the obsolete programming language is lesser, the cost to hire them will increased.
  - Technical Debt: Make the system more complex as changing the source code will increase the complexity of the system hence making developer need more time to understand the code.
  - Limited flexibility as the obsolete programming language may not have the ability to implement newer technologies 

## d
### i
- S3. As S3 has the control dependency to S4 and S6, indicating a decision point in the flow of execution where different branches can be taken depending on the result of the condition.

### ii
- S2,3,4,5,6. Those nodes will be affected as S2, S3 and S6 has a data dependency edges to the S1. Then, S4 has a data dependency edge to S2 and S5 has a data dependency to S3. Therefore, when the value of S1 is changes all other node will be affected.

# 3
## a
- Substitute algorithm. Replace the existing algorithm in the program with a new algoithm. This is becuase the performance of the new algorithm has better performance than the existing algorithm.

## b
### i
- duplication of code. The if statement is repeated many that is produce the result which is redundant.
- unnecessary and unmeaningful naming of variable. The x variable is not meaningful until it is assign to varaible exemption.

### ii
```cs
double exemptionPay() {
  if (age > 60 || monthlyIncome < 1000 || isWindow) {
    exemption = 100;
  }
  // other statement of calculation
}
```
> Since all the condition will produce the same result, therefore all condition can be check at the same time using OR statement, meaning one of the condition is true, then the exemption is 100. As the x variable will be assign to exemption variable, the value 100 can be directly assign to the exemption varaible directly.

## c
- While refactoring techniques can enhance readability, maintainability, and potentially optimize small sections of code, they typically don't address fundamental architectural limitations. In this case, the performance bottleneck likely stems from the increased load and latency introduced by integrating the originally local system with an online, multi-branch system. This integration might involve network communication, data synchronization, and other architectural considerations that code refactoring alone cannot resolve.
- Underlying System Design and Scalability Limitations: The software was initially designed to handle transactions within a local branch. This suggests that the original system architecture might not have been designed to handle the increased volume and concurrency demands of a multi-branch, online system.
- Performance Issues Might Originate from External Factors: The degradation in system performance coincides with the integration to the internet, suggesting that external factors, such as network bandwidth, server capacity, or database performance, might be the root cause. Refactoring primarily targets the organization and structure of the existing codebase. It does not directly address external performance bottlenecks. For instance, if the online system relies on a remote database, optimizing the local code for transaction processing will not alleviate delays caused by network latency or database query times.

## d
- After develop component to be reuseable, the component might not be applicable in the future goal of the company which making the component cannot be reused.
- The proactive reused model require higher initial investment to plan and design the component to be reusable. If reuse doesnâ€™t occur as expected, the investment may not pay off.
- The development team might over generalize causing overengineering, hence making more difficult to maintain the system in the future.

## b
- Assessment Model
  - Purpose: The assessment model is used to understand an organization's current ability to reuse software artifacts and identify opportunities to enhance its reuse capability. It provides a framework for evaluating the organization's current practices and identifying areas where improvements can be made.
- Implementation Model
  - Purpose: The implementation model builds upon the findings from the assessment model. It assists organizations in prioritizing the crucial success factors identified during the assessment and provides a roadmap for achieving the desired level of reuse capability.

## c
- **Strategic suppliers are crucial for service delivery:** These suppliers are deeply integrated into the organization's operations, and their performance directly affects the organization's ability to deliver its core services to its customers. The sources emphasize that the relationship with such suppliers should be managed proactively and at a high level to ensure alignment, minimize risks, and foster mutually beneficial outcomes.
- **Strategic suppliers require a collaborative approach:**  Recognizing that both parties in a supplier relationship seek to extract value, the sources emphasize the need for a shared understanding and agreement on how this value is created and delivered. This particularly applies to strategic suppliers, where the interconnectedness of operations necessitates a collaborative approach to ensure that the **combined efforts** of both the organization and the supplier contribute to delivering value in the form of desired outcomes. This collaboration might involve joint planning, shared risk management, transparent communication, and a focus on continuous improvement. The sources suggest that establishing clear expectations for value creation from both sides is essential for a successful and sustainable relationship with strategic suppliers. 

## d
- Collaboration between department is important as a system is usually very big and it involves multiple department to contribute the knowledge in developing a system.
- Furthermore, in large organisations, there are usually processes that involved multiple departments, without collaboration, it will lead to fragmented workflows, reducing effectiveness and hinder smooth delivery of IT services.
- Suggest one ITIL principle related
  - Collaborate and promote visibility 

## e
- To understand the domain of the product family and serve as a guidance for developing the future program in the product family.
- This would help in identifying the common feature in the product family, it allow development team to develop the feature that can be reused.
- The step is necessary, this is because without identifying the common feature, the componnent that is develop using the cannot be reused across the product family, hence wasting the effort.
