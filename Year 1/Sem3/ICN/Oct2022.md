- When the server B wants to send a packet to the device that is located in the same network, the packet will be sent directly to the device so it can be succesfully deliver
- When the server B wants to send a packet to the device that is not located in the same network, the packet will not be sent since not default gateway is configured and the packet will be dropped

### vi)
- Subnet 1:
  - 192.16.100.0/27 (network address)
	- 192.16.100.31/27 (broadcast address)
	- 192.16.100.1/27 (first usable address)
	- 192.16.100.30/27 (last usable address)
- Subnet 2:
  - 192.16.100.32/27 (network address)
  - 192.16.100.63/27 (broadcast address)
  - 192.16.100.33/27 (first usable address)

  - 192.16.100.94/27 (last usable address)

## b)
- smaller broadcast domain
  - Broadcast traffic to the hosts in the same subnet only
- admin more easier to manage
	- can limit the error to a smaller area(subnet)

## c)
1. Arrange according number of host
	- Engineering: 20000
	- HR: 5000
	- Accounting: 600
2. Calculate the host bits required
	- Engineering: 2^15=32768, 32768-2=32766
	- HR: 2^14=16384, 16384-2=16382
	- Accounting: 2^10=1024, 1024-2=1022
3. Calculate the network address
	- Engineering: 10.0.0.0/17
	- HR: 10.0.128.0/21
	- Accounting: 10.0.160.0/22
4. Calculate broadcast address:
	- Engineering: 10.0.127.255/17

# Q4

## a)

### i)
- File Transfer Protocol

### ii)
- Hypertext Transfer Protocol

### iii)
- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)

### iv)
- Domain Name Service

### v) Not in syllabus (ssh shud be more accurate)
- Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), Secure Shell (SSH)

## b)
- Client send DHCPDISCOVER to DHCP servers to get a list of available addresses
- DHCP server send DHCPOFFER to the request cilent
- Client send DHCPREQUEST to the DHCP server to request the address to be leased
- DHCP send DHCPACK to the request cilent to say the lease is approved, and the client can use the IP address (DHCPNACK if lease is not approved)

## c) (shud be not in syllabus as well)
- The cilent will send DHCPREQUEST to the DHCP server that it wants to use the IP address that the DHCP server offers

## d)
- John use a Mail User Agent (MUA) to draft and send the email to a SMTP server (port 25) (which can act as both Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) or Mail Delivery Agent (MDA))
- The SMTP server receives the email and notices that it is in a different domain, so it will act as a MTA and forward the email to another SMTP server
- Peter opens his MUA, or an email client, and sends either a POP (port 110) request or an IMAP (port 143) request to the server to retrieve the emails, 
  - if a POP request is used, the email is downloaded to Peter's computer and removed from the server, 
  - if an IMAP request is used, the email that Peter see is actually the copies of the email, the email will still be stored in the mail server, unless Peter manually delete it
