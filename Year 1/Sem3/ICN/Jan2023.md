- Destination IP address

## c)

### i)
- Step 1 (omit leading zeros)
	- 8810:cafe:1:a04:0:0:0:77
- Step 2 (remove all zero segments)
	- 8810:cafe:1:a04::77

### iv)
- 192.168.11.1/24

### v)
- It will fail
	- After identify the network address of PC3, it found out that PC3 does not locate in the same network
  - It will attempt to forward the frame to the gateway
  - However, the default gateway is not set, so the frame has no where to go and will be dropped

# Q2

## a)

### i)
- 190.212.224.205
  - Class B
  - Network portion: first 2 byte (190.212.0.0)
  - Host portion: last 2 byte (x.x.224.205)

### ii)
- 119.168.212.227
  - Class A
  - Network portion: first byte (119.0.0.0)
  - Host portion: last 3 byte (x.168.212.227)

## b)
- 2 Subnets
  - 2^1 = 2, which is enough for 2 subnets, we will use one bit for the subnetting
  - 2 ^ (8-1) = 2^7 = 128, 128 - 2 = 126, this will give us 126 hosts per subnet
  - First subnet: 
    - 192.168.88.0/25 (network address)
		- 192.168.88.1/25 (first usable)
		- 192.168.88.126/25 (last usable)
		- 192.168.88.127/25 (broadcast address)
  - Second subnet:
    - 192.168.88.128/25 (network address)
    - 192.168.88.129/25 (first usable)
    - 192.168.88.254/25 (last usable)
    - 192.168.88.255/25 (broadcast address)
  
## c)

### i)
`2^5=32`

### ii)
`5`

### iii)
`2^11 = 2048, 2048-2=2046`

### iv)
`16 + 5 = 21`

# Q3

## a)

### i)
`4`

### ii)
`2^2 = 4` 2 bits

### iii)
`2^2 = 4`

### iv)
`2^6 = 64, 64 - 2 = 62`

### v)
`/26`

### vi)
- Subnet 1
	- 192.168.88.0/26 (network address)
	- 192.168.88.1/26 (first usable)
	- 192.168.88.62/26 (last usable)
	- 192.168.88.63/26 (broadcast address)
- Subnet 2
  - 192.168.88.64/26 (network address)
  - 192.168.88.65/26 (first usable)
  - 192.168.88.126/26 (last usable)
  - 192.168.88.127/26 (broadcast address)
- Subnet 3
	- 192.168.88.128/26 (netwrok address)
	- 192.168.88.129/26 (first usable)
	- 192.168.88.190/26 (last usable)
	- 192.168.88.191/26 (broadcast address)
- Subnet 4
  - 192.168.88.192/26 (network address)
  - 192.168.88.193/26 (first usable)
  - 192.168.88.254/26 (last usable)
  - 192.168.88.255/26 (broadcast address)

## b)
- smaller broadcast domain
  - Broadcast traffic specific to the hosts in the subnet only
- admin more easier to manage
  - can limit the error to smaller area (the subnets)
	- admin can subnet the network based on department or block

## c)
1. Arrange in desc
  - Engineering: 2035
  - HR: 1818
  - Accounting: 788
2. Find number of host bits need to be remained (first subnet (engineering))
  - 11 host bits need to be remained: 2^11=2048, 2048-2=2046, which is enough for 2035
3. Find network address
  - 10.0.0.0/21 
4. Find broadcast address
  - 10.0.7.255/21
  - PS: CIDR = /21
5. Repeat step 2 - 4 for every subsequent subnets
  - HR:
    - Number of host bits: 11
    - Network address: 10.0.8.0/21
		- Broadcast address: 10.0.15.255/21
    - CIDR: /21
  - Accounting:
    - Number of host bits: 10
    - Network address: 10.0.16.0/22
		- Broadcast address: 10.0.19.255/22
    - CIDR: /22

# Q4

## a)
- Port numbers are used to identify the applications
- Every tab in a browser is considered as its own application, and they will be assigned a port number from the dynamic/private port range (49152 - 65535)
- Packets send from a tab will have a different port than the others and when a reply is received, the OS will direct it at that port number, so each tab will not interfere with each other

## b)
- Support retransmission
  - guarantee package will arrive
- Require acknowledgement
- Support reordering
  - Ensure same-order delivery
- Connection-oriented
  - session is established before sending actual data
- Support flow control
  - Can know the receiver not enough resource to process, can lower the sending rate
- Full featured protocol
- Ensure no packet is corrupted
- More overhead
- Slower but accurate 

## c)
- This statement is false
	- In TCP/IP model, the application layer will perform the functions of the three upper layer of the OSI model, which are application, presentation, session
