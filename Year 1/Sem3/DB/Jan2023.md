# Q1

## a)

### i)
DBMS, short for DataBase Management System, is a software tool that allows the user to create, read, update and delete data in a database, it also includes features to ensure data security, integrity and more.
- Two examples
  - Oracle SQL
  - MySQL

### ii)
- Backup facility
  - Provide backup of entire DB
  - Hot backup: Certain part of DB is shut down and backed up
  - Cold backup: Whole DB is shut down to be backed up
- Journalizing facility
  - Keep records of transactions (transaction log) and DB changes (DB Change log -> before image, after image)
- Checkpoint facility
  - Checkpoint is taken: Stops receiving new transactions, progressing transactions are completed and database is synced with the journal files
  - Can be started manually or done automatically
- Recovery manager
  - Recover the database using the journal files when failure occurs

## b)

### i)
```sql
SELECT            S.*, ProductID, Description
FROM              Supplier S
LEFT OUTER JOIN   Product P
ON                S.SupplierID = P.SupplierID;
```

### ii)
```sql
SELECT            S.*, ProductID, Description
FROM              Supplier S
FULL OUTER JOIN   Product P
ON                S.SupplierID = P.SupplierID;
```

### iii)
```sql
SELECT            S.*, ProductID, Description
FROM              Supplier S
RIGHT OUTER JOIN  Product P
ON                S.SupplierID = P.SupplierID;
```

# Q2

## a)
- Serve as a communication layer for application programmer, system designer, end user
- Good database design uses an appropriate data model as its foundation
- Organize data for end users based on their different needs
- Different user have different view of the data, data model provide whole view

## b)

### i)
Yes skip, can infer from dbdl below

### ii)

Performance(<u>PerformanceID</u>, DateTime, Venue, Price, <u>ClientID*</u>)

Client(<u>ClientID</u>, ClientName, ClientContactNo, Email)

MemberPerformance(<u>PerformanceID*</u>, <u>StaffID*</u>)

BandMember(<u>StaffID</u>, StaffName, StaffContactNo, JoinDate)

# Q3

## b)
- Insertion anomaly
  - It is not possible to insert a new competition if there is no athlete registering for it
- Modification anomaly
  - If we want to update the competition time for G100R, multiple rows need to be updated otherwise it will cause data inconsistency
- Deletion anomaly
  - If we delete the record of AthleteNo = 1004, the competition B400H with the description being boys 400m hurdles will also be deleted from the database and no longer exist

## b)
- 1NF: Remove repeating groups

Registration(<u>AthleteNo</u>, AthleteName, Gender, SchoolName, SchoolContactNo, <u>CompetitionNo</u>, Description, CompetitionTime)

// please imagine a big arrow pointing downwards here

Athlete(<u>AthleteNo</u>, AthleteName, Gender, SchoolName, SchoolContactNo)

Registration(<u>AthleteNo*</u>, <u>CompetitionNo</u>, Description, CompetitionTime)

- 2NF: Remove partial dependencies

Athlete(<u>AthleteNo</u>, AthleteName, Gender, SchoolName, SchoolContactNo)

Registration(<u>AthleteNo*</u>, <u>CompetitionNo*</u>)

Competition(<u>CompetitionNo</u>, Description, CompetitionTime)

- 3NF: Remove transitive dependencies

Athlete(<u>AthleteNo</u>, AthleteName, Gender, SchoolName*)

School(<u>SchoolName</u>, SchoolContactNo)

Registration(<u>AthleteNo*</u>, <u>CompetitionNo*</u>)

Competition(<u>CompetitionNo</u>, Description, CompetitionTime)

# Q4

## a)
```sql
CREATE TABLE ItemOrdered (
  OrderNo     NUMBER(5)     NOT NULL,
  CakeNo      NUMBER(4)     NOT NULL,
  Quantity    NUMBER(1)     NOT NULL.
  Remark      VARCHAR(255),

  PRIMARY KEY (OrderNo, CakeNo),
  FOREIGN KEY (OrderNo) REFERENCES CakeOrder(OrderNo),
  FOREIGN KEY (CakeNo)  REFERENCES Cake(CakeNo),

  CONSTRAINT CHK_QUANTITY CHECK (Quantity <= 5)
);
```

## b)
```sql
INSERT INTO Cake(CakeNo, CakeName, Weight, Price)
VALUES (1013, 'Lemon Cheese Cake', 0.5, 103.00);
```

## c)
```sql
UPDATE  Customer
SET     ContactNo = '012-3456789'
WHERE   CustNo = (
  SELECT CustNo FROM CakeOrder
  WHERE OrderNo = 10021
);
```

## d)
```sql
DELETE FROM Cake
WHERE CakeNo = 1002;
```

## e)
```sql
SELECT    C.CakeNo, CakeName, Weight, SUM(Quantity) AS TotalQuantity
FROM      ItemOrdered I, Cake C, CakeOrder CO
WHERE     I.OrderNo = CO.OrderNo
  AND     I.CakeNo = C.CakeNo
  AND     PickupDate = '09/02/2023'
GROUP BY  C.CakeNo, CakeName, Weight
ORDER BY  TotalQuantity DESC;
```
