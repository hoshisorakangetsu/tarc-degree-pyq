# Q1

## a)
- Persona
  - Persona is a user model that represent an individual, specific person. However, they are not real person but they are created based real world observation.
  - Includes skills, attitude, goals, pain points, activities
  - We can observe multiple TARUC students and create personas based on them, that identifies their goals using the application and their activities they normally carry out to identify how the application can fit in their life
- Hierarchical Task Analysis
  - Can identify how the student will finds parking lots availability currently
  - Break down tasks into subtasks
  - To make new system compatible with the current way the user does the job

## b)
- User: Inefficiency
  - With a bad interface design such as unconsistency will reduce user productivity
  - Without consistency in the website, the user will not be able to develop transferable skills
  - Therefore, once they navigate to other pages, they will need to relearn the actions of button in the page and it increase the learning curve of the website.
  - For example, the icon of the find buttons in home page and my car page are same, but the function of them in each page are different, in home page once the find button is clicked, the system will find the parking lot available at TARC, but when the find      button is at my car page, the button will find the location of car when the button is clicked.
- Developer: Increased customer support cost
  - When the user does not know how to perform a certain task in the website, or is confused by a button on the website, they will contact the developer to get more information, therefore increasing the customer support cost.
  - For example, the user does not know how to identify whether a parking lot is available or not, the developers will need to provide customer support to help them continue using the website, thus inreasing the customer support cost

## c)
- Fitt's law
  - The shorter the distance and the bigger the area of an element, the shorter the time required for a person to move the mouse pointer to the element
- Example: Make button size bigger and distance between action buttons smaller

# Q2

## a)

### i)
- Slip: Error occur when correct intention, wrong action, often happen when misclicks
  - One of the possible slip that can happen in the scenario is when selecting location, places that are close together may be selected instead of the real location that the user wants to select
- Mistake: Error occur when incorrect action is taken based on an incorrect decision, it is caused by lack of understanding of the system
  - Example for mistake is the user's intention is to check the ceiling price of groceries, but the user click on the button to check the current price of the groceries because the same icon is used for both functions

### ii)
- Issue: Inefficiency
  - Use more time compare the price between shop
    - because there may be too many items displayed randomly at one page, the user will need to navigate back and forth to compare the price of the same item between different shops
- Solution: Chunking
  - Chunk the groceries based on the item, display the same item and the price from 7 +- 2 shops in one page, alongside the government's ceiling price to facilitate comparison

## b)
- Metaphors are often used to describe unfamiliar concepts with familiar items
- Different understanding of the metaphor
  - If the user and the designer have different background, the user might understand the metaphor differently from the designer
  - For example, an open door icon can represent exit or enter based on the people understanding

# Q3

## a)
- Reduce learning curve
  - The user will be able to transfer the skills they learnt from exploring one page to the other if the design is consistent throughout the website, this allows the user to develop transferrable skills that can be applied throughout the whole website, since the design is consistent, the user do not need to learn how the part works anymore thus reducing learning curve
  - For example, the location of the navigation bar should be located in the same location on every page, by designing the navigation bar on the same location, when the user navigate to another page, they do not need to look for the navigation bar anymore as it will always be in the same place, thus it transfers the knowledge of the location of the navigation bar to the other page of the website, therefore reducing the learning curve of the website

## b)
- Encourage user to explore the website
  - When navigating a website, the user are mostly afraid of exploring because they scare they might put the website on an error state causing it not possible to revert the website into a previous state and need to reload the whole page, by providing easy reversal of actions, the user will not be afraid to explore the website as they know they can always reverse the website to a previous state
  - For example, we can provide an 'X' button for the user to close the detailed information of a candidate. This lets the user explore the website entirely as they know they can simply go back and watch the whole live result even if they clicked or accidentally clicked on the candidates and opened the detailed information of the candidates

## c)
- Efficiency stands for the amount the resources used to complete a task or achieve a result
- The amount of effort used, for example, how long a user will take to view the detailed information of a candidate

# Q4

## a)
- Environment: 
  - Lab study provides an uninterrupted environment when the evaluation is taken place, it is also conducted in a safe environment so it is also ideal to be selected if the system is located at a dangerous location
  - Field study provides natural and context retained environment
- Cost:
  - Lab studies are more expensive
  - Field studies are cheaper

## b)
- Lofi
  - Good communication tool between designer and client
    - As the client can see the idea instead just listen, the cilent can express their thoughts for improve the design to the designer
  - Cheap to develop
    - Lofi is usually develop using paper and pen
  - Fast to brainstorm ideas
    - Lofi can be drawn out using few sketches
  - Use to compare multiply design idea
    - Lofi can be fastly done and cheap, so we can draw out multiple design and choose the best among them
  - Address layout design
    - Due to it's nature of sketching, it is best used to identify which layout is suitable for the design

## c)
- Temperature
  - Place the air con remote at place that the students can easily access and notice to adjust the surrounding temperature easily
  - Optimal: 20 to 24 degree celsius
  - Temperature will affect the performance of the student
  - Once performance of the student is affected, the productivity of student is affected and the quality of work is decrease
  - If temperature of library is too cold or hot, the student will be sick and feel uncomfortable
- Lighting
  - Make sure lighting is comfortable, if possible, provide table lamp for the tables so the students can adjust the lighting on their own
  - Optimal: 300 - 500 lumen
    - Spaces with not very bright light, 300 lumen best
    - Space with brighter environment, 400 - 500 lumen is best
  - If the library is too bright or too dull, it can cause eye disorders to the student

- Extra
  - Noise level: 50db
